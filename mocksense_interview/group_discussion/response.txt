Group Discussion Topic: Revival of Dire Wolf

Male:
1. I think bringing back the dire wolf would be amazing, just imagine seeing those massive canines roaming around again! It'd be like something out of Game of Thrones, but real. Plus, they could potentially help control populations of deer and elk, which are sometimes overpopulated in certain areas.
2. I do worry about the impact on existing ecosystems though. Would they outcompete other predators like wolves and bears?  We'd have to be really careful about introducing them and make sure they wouldn't disrupt the balance too much.  Lots of research would be needed.
3. And what about the ethical side?  Is it really our place to bring back an extinct species?  What if they suffer in our modern world? We'd have to make absolutely sure they could thrive and not just survive.  It's a huge responsibility.

Female:
1. That's so true about the ecosystem, we have to consider the unintended consequences.  Think about diseases, too!  Could they bring back old diseases or catch new ones that could spread to other animals?  That could be devastating.  We've seen that happen with other species introductions.
2. On the other hand, studying their DNA and how they lived could give us so much insight into evolution and even help us develop new technologies. Maybe their genes hold secrets to disease resistance or something we haven't even thought of yet!
3. I'm torn about the ethics, too.  Part of me thinks it's cool, but another part feels like playing God.  We'd have to create a carefully managed environment for them, which feels a little sad. Would they truly be wild?  Or just living in a glorified zoo?  That's something we'd have to consider really seriously.
