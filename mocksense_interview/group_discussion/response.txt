Group Discussion Topic: The impact of social media on body image, especially among young people.

Male:
1. I think social media definitely plays a big role.  You see all these filtered photos and influencers with seemingly "perfect" bodies, and it's easy to start comparing yourself and feeling inadequate.  It can be tough, especially for younger people still figuring things out.
2. On the flip side, I've also seen body-positive movements gaining traction online.  There are more accounts promoting self-love and acceptance, which is a good counterbalance.  It's all about finding the right people to follow, I guess.
3. Honestly, I think education is key. We need to teach kids and teens how to be critical consumers of social media, to understand that it's not always a realistic portrayal of life.

Female:
1. Totally agree about the pressure. I know I've felt it myself.  It's like you're constantly bombarded with images of what you're "supposed" to look like, and it can be really damaging to your self-esteem.
2. I also think it can mess with your perception of beauty.  Everything's so airbrushed and edited, it sets unrealistic standards.  People start to believe that's what they should strive for, which is just not attainable or healthy.
3. Something I've noticed is how addictive it can be.  You keep scrolling and scrolling, comparing yourself to others, and it becomes this vicious cycle. It's important to take breaks and remember that real life isn't always what you see online.
