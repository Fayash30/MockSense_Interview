Group Discussion Topic: The impact of social media on body image, especially among young people.

Male:
1. I think social media definitely plays a role.  You see all these filtered photos and influencers with seemingly "perfect" bodies, and it's easy to feel inadequate.  It can make you hyper-aware of your own perceived flaws.
2. It's not all bad though.  There are body-positive accounts and communities online that promote self-acceptance and celebrate different body types.  Finding those can be really helpful for building confidence.
3. I guess the key is being mindful of what you consume online.  If certain accounts or content make you feel bad about yourself, maybe it's time to unfollow or take a break.

Female:
1. Totally agree.  It's so easy to get caught up in comparing yourself to others online. I know I've definitely fallen into that trap before.  It can really mess with your self-esteem.
2. And it's not just about the pictures. It's also the constant pressure to keep up with the latest trends and beauty standards. It can be exhausting and expensive trying to achieve this often unattainable image.
3. I think education is a big part of the solution.  Teaching young people about media literacy and helping them develop critical thinking skills so they can recognize unrealistic portrayals and not internalize those messages.
