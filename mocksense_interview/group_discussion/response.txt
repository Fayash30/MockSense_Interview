Group Discussion Topic: The impact of social media on mental well-being.

Male:
1. I think social media can be a real double-edged sword. On one hand, it's great for staying connected with friends and family, especially those far away.  But on the other, it's easy to get caught up in comparing yourself to others and feeling inadequate.
2. It's also crazy how addictive it can be.  You know, you just open Instagram "for a second" and suddenly an hour's gone.  I've been trying to be more mindful of my usage lately.
3. One thing I've noticed is how news and information, even if it's not accurate, spreads so quickly on social media. It can be hard to know what to believe sometimes.

Female:
1. Totally agree with you about the comparison thing.  It’s so easy to fall into that trap of thinking everyone else’s life is perfect based on their curated online persona. I’ve definitely felt that pressure myself.
2. I think it can be great for creative expression though.  Platforms like TikTok and Instagram allow people to share their talents and connect with others who have similar interests. That's a positive aspect for sure.
3. And it's not all bad for mental health. I use social media to follow groups related to my hobbies, and it helps me feel part of a community. It’s been really helpful for making new friends actually.
