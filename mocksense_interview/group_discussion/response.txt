Group Discussion Topic: The impact of social media on mental well-being.

Male:
1. I think social media can be a real double-edged sword.  It's great for staying connected with friends and family, especially those far away, but it also puts a lot of pressure on people to present a perfect life, which can be really damaging.
2. One thing I've noticed is how addictive it can be. You start scrolling through your feed and suddenly an hour's gone by! It can be a real time suck and distract you from more important things, like work or studies.
3. And then there's the whole cyberbullying thing. It's so easy for people to hide behind anonymous profiles and say hurtful things they'd never say in person. That can have a devastating impact on people's self-esteem.

Female:
1. I totally agree about the pressure to present a perfect life. It's like everyone's constantly comparing themselves to others, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. I know I've definitely felt that way sometimes.
2. I also think it can be really isolating, ironically. You're "connected" to hundreds of people online, but you might not have any real, meaningful connections in your actual life.  It's like a false sense of community, you know?
3. But I do think social media can be a force for good, too. It can be a great way to raise awareness about important issues, connect with like-minded people, and even build communities around shared interests.  It's all about how you use it, I guess.
